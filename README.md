# Catan AI

## Purpose

I seek to create a narrow artificial inteligence to play Settlers of Catan.

## Requirements
Currently, Catan AI requires `Python 3` and `NumPY`. This may change in the
future.

## Development Goals

Board features:

- Complete representation of the hexagonal board.
- Ability to handle multiple players.
- Management of development cards and resources

AI:
- Ability to rank positions to minimize victory points per turn.
- Ability to select development options optimally.
- Addition of different strategies for robber placement (random, tit-for-tat, 
etc.)
